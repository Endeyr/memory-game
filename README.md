# Memory Card Game

## Description

This is a memory card game built with Vite, React, Typescript, CSS, and HTML. The user clicks on an image, the images shuffle, and the user tries to click on a different image, repeating until the user clicks on an image already clicked. The user wins when they have clicked on each image only once. This project is apart of the Odin Project React course. The site is hosted on [Cloudflare](https://memory-game-4mx.pages.dev/)
